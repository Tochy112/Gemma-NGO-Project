      HARM What is Self Harm? All forms of self-harm are used as a way of
      managing difficult or distressing feelings or experiences. Self-harm can
      be a way of coping for lots of different people in society – young or old,
      so its not just young people who self-harm. If you are struggling with
      difficult thoughts, feelings or experiences and using self-harm as a way
      of dealing with them, there is a strong possibility that you are not the
      only one in your class or circle of friends.   PRIVATE FOSTERING WHAT IS
      PRIVATE FOSTERING? If you are under 16 (or 18 if you have a disability)
      and live with an adult who is not a close relative, such as your mum or
      dad, a brother, a sister, an aunt or uncle, a step parent or grandparent
      then you are privately fostered. Your mum or dad will have agreed that the
      other person can take care of you and they may be paying some money to
      help the person do this. WHY DOES IT HAPPEN? Your mum and dad might be
      experiencing some difficulties and may have asked another adult to care
      for you. This could be for a number of reasons. WHAT HAPPENS TO ME? The
      law says that because you are being cared for by someone who is not a
      close relative, we need to make sure you are well supported and cared for.
      WHAT WILL THE SOCIAL WORKER DO? The social worker will come and see you
      where you live and make sure you are happy. They will talk to the person
      who cares for you and see if they need any help. They will talk to your
      mum and dad to find out how much contact they have with you. and how they
      are able to make sure you are being well cared for. CAN I STILL SEE MY MUM
      OR DAD? Yes, this is one of the things we can talk to you about. We will
      also speak to your mum and dad and the people caring for you about this.
      WHAT IF I&apos;M NOT HAPPY? If you are not happy where you are living, you
      can tell us when we visit you. If you do not know this person very well,
      you can talk to an adult you do know well and trust, perhaps a teacher at
      school. These people can work together to help sort out any problems and
      support you. WHO CAN I SPEAK TO IF I WANT TO FIND OUT MORE? If you want to
      ask anything about private fostering, you can talk to a social worker by
      calling 09021250040 or you can find out more information online at “ page
      link” SEXUAL EXPLOITATION What is child sexual exploitation? Child Sexual
      Exploitation is where someone is taking advantage of you (or someone you
      know) sexually for their own benefit. Sexual exploitation can happen to
      boys and young men as well as girls and young women. It can happen to
      anyone and people who exploit you can be any age, male or female. How does
      it happen? Sexual exploitation can be hard to recognise because often it
      feels like that you are in a good relationship with the person – or people
      – who abuse your trust in them. It could be that you are exploited by a
      friend, or group of friends, or someone you think of as a boyfriend or
      girlfriend or it might be a person or a new group of people you’ve only
      just got to know, either in person or online. Often people who exploit you
      are nice to you, your friends and family; they might buy you things,
      including alcohol or drugs, they might listen to your problems, take you
      to great places, be there for you, and they might give you a place to stay
      when you’ re having problems. Anyone who persuades you to have sex with
      them or other people, or encourages you to post sexual images of yourself
      via text or on the internet, in return for the things that they have given
      you, such as drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, money, food, accommodation or
      affection, is sexually exploiting you, even if you don’t always feel like
      they are. If what you are being asked or forced to do makes you feel
      uncomfortable or worried in some way and somehow feels wrong then remember
      it probably is. If you are worried for yourself or a friend, please talk
      to an adult you trust. Remember: if you are in any danger or feel unsafe,
      get in contact with the police immediately on 999. If you would like to
      talk to someone in confidence you can contact: Childline - You can call
      them free on 08162166912 and this number won’t appear on a telephone bill.
      Available 24 hours a day. RELATIONSHIP/DOMESTIC ABUSE Domestic abuse is

      worried you might be living with domestic abuse please keep reading –
      you’re not alone. Domestic abuse happens in many families. If it’s
      happening in your family it’s important to remember it’s not your fault
      and there are people that can help. You can TALK TO a trusted adult, a
      teacher, nurse, youth worker or you can call: Childline - on 08162166912.
