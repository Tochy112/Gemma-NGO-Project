      <p>
        This part of the website is for you if you are 18 or older, and need
        help to keep yourself safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone has a right to live without abuse and neglect and to be treated
        fairly, with dignity and respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safeguarding adults is about preventing and responding to allegations of
        abuse or neglect of adults with care and support needs in Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gemma&apos;s Foundation aims to work with local people and our partners
        so that adults with care and support needs are safe and able to protect
        themselves from abuse and neglect.
      </p>
      <p>
        For you to get safeguarding help, the level of care or support you need
        doesn&apos;t matter, nor does it matter whether or not you have anyone
        to help you with those needs.
      </p>
      <p>You might need care and support to help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>get out of bed, get dressed or washed</li>
        <li>eat or cook meals</li>
        <li>to see family or friends</li>
        <li>manage health problems, including mental health difficulties</li>
        <li>
          know when you&apos;re not safe and / or what to do when you don&apos;t
          feel safe
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You might have difficulty keeping yourself safe and protecting yourself
        from abuse and neglect because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you have a physical disability</li>
        <li>you have a learning disability</li>
        <li>you experience mental health problems</li>
        <li>you have autism or Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome</li>
        <li>you misuse alcohol or other substances</li>
        <li>you have difficulty seeing or hearing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className=" font-bold">I DON&apos;T FEEL SAFE</h2>
      <p>
        If you don&apos;t feel safe, find someone you trust to talk to about how
        you are feeling, or use one of the contact numbers below.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Talk to someone you trust - a friend, a relative, a carer, or the
          person in charge of your care (whether the care is being provided to
          you at home or in a hospital or a residential care home).
        </li>
        <li>
          Phone 08162166912 - and tell the operator you don&apos;t feel safe.
          this is the Council&apos;s safeguarding helpline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Police - phone 911 in an emergency if you don&apos;t feel safe but are
          not in immediate danger. Remember, abuse is always wrong and it is
          never your fault!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You may be unsure about whether what is happening to you counts as abuse
        and neglect.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you do have a feeling that things aren&apos;t right, or you
        feel uncomfortable with what&apos;s happening, or you are frightened of
        someone, don&apos;t keep it to yourself.
      </p>
      <h2 className=" font-bold">TYPES OF ABUSE</h2>
