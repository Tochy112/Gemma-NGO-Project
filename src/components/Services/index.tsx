          The main aim of the service is to give emotional support to people
          when they are suicidal. Our services also alleviate misery,
          loneliness, despair and depression by listening to anyone who feels
          they have nowhere else to turn. The people who run the Our services –
          Gemma&apos;s Foundation – are volunteers who have all been specially
          trained. The work is non-political and non-religious, and volunteers
          do not try to impose their convictions on anyone. They simply listen.
          The fact that someone has been in contact with a service – whether by
          telephone, letter, email, internet chat, SMS text message or in a
          face-to-face meeting – is strictly confidential. So too is everything
          that the person tells a Befriender. Some callers prefer to remain
          anonymous – and that&apos;s fine.
